    "Boosting is a popular ensemble learning technique in machine learning, which aims to improve the accuracy of weak learners by combining them to create a strong learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "In boosting, a series of weak classifiers or models are trained sequentially, where each subsequent model tries to correct the errors of the previous one. At each iteration, the model assigns higher weights to the misclassified examples, making it more focused on correctly classifying them in the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, boosting creates a powerful ensemble model that can accurately classify instances that the individual models could not classify correctly. One of the most commonly used boosting algorithms is the AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting), which is known for its ability to achieve high accuracy with low variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting has applications in a wide range of machine learning tasks, including classification, regression, and ranking problems. It is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional and noisy data, where a single strong model may overfit to the training data."
