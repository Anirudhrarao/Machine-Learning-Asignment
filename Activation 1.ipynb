    "An activation function in the context of artificial neural networks is a mathematical function that introduces non-linearity to the output of a neuron or a layer of neurons. It determines whether a neuron should be activated (fire) or not based on the weighted sum of its inputs. Activation functions allow neural networks to learn and model complex relationships in the data by introducing non-linear transformations. They help in achieving the neural network's ability to approximate any arbitrary function and make the network more expressive and powerful."

    "3. Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU): It is a piecewise linear function that outputs the input if it is positive, and zero otherwise. It is given by the formula: f(x) = max(0, x). ReLU has become very popular due to its simplicity and effectiveness in training deep neural networks.\n",

    "The softmax activation function is used in the output layer of a neural network for multi-class classification. It takes a vector of real numbers as input and converts them into a probability distribution over different classes. The function exponentiates each element, normalizes the results to sum up to 1, and assigns probabilities to each class. It amplifies larger values and suppresses smaller values, making it suitable for selecting the most probable class. The softmax function is differentiable, enabling efficient training using techniques like backpropagation."

Smooth and differentiable activation functions ensure smooth gradient flow, making it easier for the network to converge during training.\n",

On the other hand, activation functions like ReLU help alleviate this issue by preventing the gradient from becoming too small.\n",

More expressive activation functions allow the network to model complex relationships and capture intricate patterns in the data.

    "The choice of the small constant 'a' in leaky ReLU can be made during model design or learned during the training process using techniques like parameter initialization or backpropagation. The value of 'a' is typically set to a small positive value, such as 0.01, ensuring a small but non-zero gradient flow for negative inputs.\n",
