    "The contingency matrix consists of four possible outcomes: true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN).

In such cases, the pair confusion matrix can provide a more accurate assessment of the performance of the classifier, and help to identify areas for improvement.\n",

    "\n",
    "Unlike intrinsic measures, which evaluate the quality of a language model in isolation, extrinsic measures assess its usefulness in real-world applications. For example, a machine translation system may achieve a high score on an intrinsic measure like perplexity but still perform poorly in translating real-world text. Therefore, an extrinsic measure would provide a more accurate assessment of its performance.\n",

    "To evaluate the performance of a language model using an extrinsic measure, researchers typically train the model on a large corpus of text and then test its performance on a specific downstream task. They then compare the model's performance to that of other models or human performance, using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, or mean squared error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extrinsic measures are important in NLP because they provide a more realistic evaluation of a language model's effectiveness in solving real-world problems.
