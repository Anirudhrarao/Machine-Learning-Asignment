    "The main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric in KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) is the way they measure the distance between data points.\n",

    "Euclidean distance measures the straight-line distance between two points in a two-dimensional or multi-dimensional space. It calculates the square root of the sum of the squared differences between corresponding coordinates. Mathematically, it can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "d(x, y) = sqrt((x1 - y1)^2 + (x2 - y2)^2 + ... + (xn - yn)^2)\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the Manhattan distance measures the distance between two points by calculating the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding coordinates. It calculates the distance as the sum of the differences in the horizontal and vertical directions (hence, the name Manhattan distance). Mathematically, it can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "d(x, y) = |x1 - y1| + |x2 - y2| + ... + |xn - yn|\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference in the way the two distance metrics measure the distance between data points can affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor. In some cases, the choice of distance metric can lead to different results. For instance, if the data points are clustered together, the Euclidean distance metric may be more effective as it takes into account the overall distance between the points. However, if the data points are dispersed or have outliers, the Manhattan distance metric may be more robust as it only considers the absolute differences between coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the choice of distance metric in KNN should be based on the nature of the data and the problem being solved. In general, it is advisable to try both distance metrics and select the one that performs better for the given dataset and problem."

    "Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a common technique used to evaluate the performance of a KNN model with different k values. In k-fold cross-validation, the data is split into k equal parts, and the model is trained on k-1 parts and tested on the remaining part. This process is repeated k times, and the performance of the model is averaged over the k iterations. The optimal k value is the one that produces the highest accuracy or lowest error rate on the test data.\n",
