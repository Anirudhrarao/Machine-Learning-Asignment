    "One example of a real-world application of bagging in machine learning is in the field of credit risk assessment for lending institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lending institutions such as banks, credit card companies, and loan providers need to assess the credit risk of applicants before deciding whether to approve a loan or credit application. This involves analyzing various factors such as income, employment history, credit history, and other personal information to determine the likelihood of the applicant defaulting on the loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging can be used in this context to improve the accuracy of the credit risk assessment model. Multiple subsets of the training data can be created using bootstrapping, and a decision tree classifier can be trained on each subset. The predictions of the individual decision trees can then be combined by taking a majority vote to produce a final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach helps to reduce the variance of the individual decision trees and improve the stability of the ensemble, leading to better generalization performance and more accurate credit risk assessments. Bagging can also help to identify important features that contribute to credit risk and provide insights into the decision-making process.\n",
