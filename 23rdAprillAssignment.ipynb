    "The curse of dimensionality refers to the fact that as the number of features or dimensions in a dataset increases, the difficulty of analyzing and processing that data also increases exponentially. This means that as the number of dimensions increases, the amount of data required to accurately represent the distribution of the data also increases exponentially.\n",
