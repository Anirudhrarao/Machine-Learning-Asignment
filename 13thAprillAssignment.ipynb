    "Random Forest Regressor is a type of machine learning algorithm used for regression tasks. It is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to create a forest of trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works by randomly selecting a subset of features and data samples from the training set, and building a decision tree based on those subsets. The process is repeated multiple times, creating a forest of decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a new data point is fed into the model, it is evaluated by each decision tree in the forest, and the outputs from all the trees are averaged to produce a final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor is a popular algorithm for regression tasks because it can handle large datasets with high dimensionality, and is robust to noise and outliers. It also provides a measure of feature importance, which can be useful for feature selection and interpretation."
